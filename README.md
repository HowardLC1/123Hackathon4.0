# MVP-Citizen-Engagement-System

🏛️ MVP Citizen Engagement System
A lightweight backend-driven system to help citizens submit complaints and feedback related to public services. The platform categorizes issues into Education, Health, and Sport, and routes them to the appropriate agency for timely action.
